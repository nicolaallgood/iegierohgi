Hoping for a little help here. I recently restored a 1950's 3 phase unisaw and I'm using a vfd to run it on single phase. The vfd works great but I'm sick of using the tiny buttons on it to turn the saw on and off. I bought a nice paddle switch to hook up to the low voltage side of the vfd so I can start/stop it easier. I can't figure out how to wire up the switch though, I've attached a couple pics of the ports on the vfd and a diagram from the paddle switch. Any ideas what should be hooked. As the title indicates, what could I be missing to conclude the cause of this? Before I start, know that I am no longer on site and the customer approved the design (with full discretion :) ), so it was never solved, but it bugs me enough to still want to know the answer. 20HP SEW Eurodrive motors, Allen-Bradley Powerflex 525 VFDs. Neither motor heated up beyond normal operating temp. Both are 9-wire motors and were wired correctly for the higher voltage option. VFD voltage is 480V. To my knowl. I recently purchased a new mill. 3hp, 230v 3 phase. 1725 rpm. I picked up a GS2 from automation and they are telling me I cant run the drive through.
